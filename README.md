# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### I choose bootstrap for styling in the front end 
Responsive Design: Bootstrap is known for its mobile-first approach and responsive grid system.Bootstrap makes it easy to create a responsive design that looks good on various devices and screen sizes.

Integration with Other Technologies: If Bootstrap integrates well with other technologies or libraries you are using in the project.

Pre-built Components: Bootstrap comes with a variety of pre-built components like navigation bars, modals, forms, etc. These components can save development time and provide a consistent look and feel across different parts of your application

### Anything you would do differently if you had additional time

User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication using JWT. This involves creating a secure login mechanism that issues a token upon successful authentication.
Set up authorization rules to control access to different parts of your application based on user roles and permissions.

### Anything you would do differently if you had additional time

Modular Routing:

Organize your routes in a modular way. Group related routes together, and consider breaking them into separate files or modules based on functionality (e.g., authentication routes, user routes, etc.).

Middleware Usage:

Implement middleware functions where necessary. Middleware can handle tasks such as authentication, logging, validation, and more. This helps in keeping your route handlers clean and focused on specific functionality.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
 ### npm install 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
